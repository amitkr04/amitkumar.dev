          </h1>
          <p className="lg:text-xl text-base text-slate-300 mb-4   leading-relaxed text-justify">
            I recently completed my B.Tech in Information Technology from Narula
            Institute of Technology, Kolkata, where I developed a strong
            foundation in software development and modern web technologies.

          <p className="lg:text-xl text-base text-slate-300 mb-4   leading-relaxed text-justify">
            My professional journey began with hands-on experience as a MERN
            Stack Developer at Webstack Academy, where I was involved in
            building dynamic and responsive full-stack applications. This
            experience taught me the importance of creating scalable,
            user-centric solutions.

          <p className="lg:text-xl text-base text-slate-300 mb-4   leading-relaxed text-justify">
            Currently, I'm working as a Frontend Developer at Walsis India Pvt.
            Ltd., where I focus on creating modern, user-friendly web interfaces
            using cutting-edge technologies like React.js, Tailwind CSS, and
            more. I'm always eager to learn new tools, solve real-world
            problems, and contribute to impactful digital products.
